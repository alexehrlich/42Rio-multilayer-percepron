# Multilayer Perceptron
This project is about coding a neural network from scratch to classify breast cancer data to be benign or malignant using backpropagation and gradient descent based on a real [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) provided by the University of Wisconsin.

## Usage

1. Run `make setup` to install all the dependencies in a virtualenv.
2. Run `make preprocess_data` to split the data set in train, validation and test subsets giving a desired ratio.
4. Run `make train_classifier` to train the multilayer neural network based on the breast cancer data with the test and avalidation set from preprocessing.
5. Run `make train_car_linreg` to train a single input output neural network to realize the linear regresssion model from ft_linear_regresssion with a neural network
6. Run `make prediction` to use the test data set from preprocessing to test the classifier with unseen data.

## Neural Networks

- What is a perceptron?
- Neural network strucutre with weights and biases? LEave space to add image
- Matrix and vector representation and forward pass? LEave space to add image
- loss functions
  
## Backpropagation
- Why?
