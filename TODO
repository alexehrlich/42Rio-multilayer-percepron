- Check LAyer requirements before training:
	- T first layer is of type input? --
	- T last layer is of tyoe output? --
	- T only one input and outputlayer in the net? --
	- T At least two hidden layers? --
	- T check that num nodes passed is > 0 --
	- T passed layer types can only be input, hidden, output --
	- T Check dimension of the input features and the first layer--
	- T Output must have softmax activation --

- Implement mini batches:

- check different weight inits like heUniform etc

- Calc Validation loss while training
- calc validation accuracy in each epoch
- Calc Binary Cross Entropy in prediction


- maybe make the output shape more felxible

- understand Softmax
- understand BCE nad CCE

- write nice Readme with all the math
- Document the math of Softmax + CCE --> see book notes
