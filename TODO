- Check LAyer requirements before training:
	- first layer is of type input?
	- last layer is of tyoe output?
	- only one input and outputlayer in the net?
	- At least two hidden layers?
	- passed layer types can only be input, hidden, output
	- Check dimension of the input features and the first layer

- Calc Validation loss while training
- calc validation accuracy in each epoch
- Calc Binary Cross Entropy in prediction

- Document the math of Softmax + CCE --> see book notes

- maybe make the output shape more felxible

- understand Softmax
- understand BCE nad CCE
- understand the comb of CCE and softmax calculation

- write nice Readme with all the math
